In terms of how it works, it creates a HashMap that stores the reward for taking an action at a particular state. After peforming the action, the value is updated with the reward found in the next state, and the max reward that can be gotten from any actions taken from the next state. This causes a form of backpropogation which allows for the algorithm to know how to get to the state with the highest reward."]],"mod":[["structs",""]]});
